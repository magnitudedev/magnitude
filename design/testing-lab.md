# Testing lab

The lab validates final application packages and their user-visible behavior. It owns test
orchestration, disposable environments, fixtures and evidence; release owns compilation,
packaging and trust. Product runtimes never import the lab. Benchmarks are not acceptance gates.

## Inputs and execution

A run binds an immutable source snapshot or existing artifact manifest, explicit target and case
selection, isolation mode and resource limits. Source includes tracked changes, nonignored new
files and recursive submodule working trees. Concurrent mutation invalidates a snapshot. Every
download and extracted file is integrity checked; extraction cannot escape its owned directory.
Existing artifacts are never rebuilt or relabelled as a successful compilation.

`iterate` may reuse an owner-scoped lease and build cache. `verify` uses clean source, build output
and consumer state. Neither mode may touch a developer's normal application data. Local execution
requires an isolated profile, and privileged install/uninstall is restricted to disposable hosts.

`quick`, `pr`, `full` and `release` select cases and targets. Target expansion is explicit, including
unqualified targets. Missing capacity or credentials blocks a case; it never removes it or makes
it pass. Release acceptance requires final production-signed artifacts and complete coverage.

## Responsibilities

The coordinator durably records admission, work, attempts, leases, events and results. Allocators
own Azure, Namespace, office Spark or local-machine leases. Transports execute bounded worker
commands. Scenario drivers interact with the installed application, endpoint, actual harness or
bundled CLI. No mocked model response, developer binary or hosted provider can satisfy generation.

The nine suites are package, install, app, endpoint, harness, recovery, CLI, update and uninstall.
Pi, OpenCode and Hermes are the initial harnesses. Configuration must be produced through the
product's Connections surface. Endpoint and harness tests attest the requested backend/device;
CPU fallback fails a Metal/CUDA target. Generation checks output/protocol/tool behavior, not speed.

## Ownership and recovery

Admission is idempotent and reserves a bounded budget. Durable transactional claims and monotonic
attempt fences prevent stale workers from committing results. Workers receive only scoped run
credentials; untrusted source never receives provider credentials or office-network access.
Spark is opt-in for trusted source, exclusive within the lab and subject to a busy-device check.

Every rented resource is tagged with lab/run/lease identity and an absolute expiry. Cancellation,
timeouts and failures release owned resources; reconciliation also inventories providers to find
allocations lost between provisioning and persistence. Cleanup failures remain visible independently
of test results. No test assertion is automatically retried. Infrastructure retry preserves the
original attempt and evidence.

## Evidence and acceptance

Each case records its input identity, observed hardware, outcome, diagnostics and evidence paths.
Blocked prerequisites propagate without hiding the original product failure. Pass means every
required selected case passed and cleanup completed. Tests must demonstrate corrupt-input rejection,
source fidelity, cancellation, stale-worker fencing, allocation ambiguity recovery, backend mismatch
rejection and exact package consumption. Execution on one target never qualifies another.

Linux coverage is limited to Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora and Red Hat using existing DEB/RPM artifacts.
SUSE, Arch, Omarchy and Alpine packaging are future work. Provider credits and quotas do not confer
Windows licensing, signing identities or GPU availability; these are independently observed gates.
