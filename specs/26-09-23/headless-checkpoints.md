# Headless implementation checkpoints

Execution authority: [full plan](headless-serve-implementation.md).
Branch: `headless`. Planning baseline: `772cfacb`.

## Planning checkpoint

Completed 2026-09-23: consolidated the original feature proposal and update investigations; inspected
native/package acceptance scripts; verified read-only connectivity to local test environments.
This checkpoint changes documentation only. No implementation tests, updater reproduction, native
installation, VM reset, service stop, release upload or publication was performed in this planning turn.

Environment observations:

- Parallels `Windows 11` running; ARM64 guest; SYSTEM and `--current-user` execution verified. Current
  user is `trg`. x64 Bun and Node tool directories located; their pinned versions still need checking.
- Lima `magnitude-ci` running on VZ, Ubuntu 22.04.5 aarch64, user systemd and sudo available. Port 10100
  occupied. Repository mounted read-only. Lima binary located in `specs/26-09-10/linux-vm/toolchain/bin`.
- `tom@sparky` reachable, Ubuntu 24.04.4 aarch64 with NVIDIA GB10, user systemd running. Existing
  checkout has a modified inference submodule. Use a new checkout; no changes made remotely.
- Existing CI provides x64 OS lanes and hosted/signed acceptance infrastructure. Access to required
  credentials/runners and RPM/macOS-x64 runtime coverage remain to be verified.

## Required entry for every implementation checkpoint

- Commit identity and changed behavior; record the parent source identity used for test builds.
- Exact commands, runtime/compiler/OS/architecture and artifact hashes/versions.
- Passing scenarios; failed scenarios with diagnosis; skipped scenarios and missing infrastructure.
- Evidence directory/CI receipt and owned-resource cleanup result.
- Decisions resolved (particularly Phase 2) and remaining gates affecting later phases.
- Next phase and its entry prerequisites.

Do not mark a phase passed while its required native evidence is missing. Commit independently
complete improvements if an external gate blocks other work; clearly retain the blocked gate here.
