# Headless implementation checkpoints

Execution authority: [full plan](headless-serve-implementation.md).
Branch: `headless`. Planning baseline: `772cfacb`.

## Planning checkpoint

Completed 2026-09-23: consolidated the original feature proposal and update investigations; inspected
native/package acceptance scripts; verified read-only connectivity to local test environments.
This checkpoint changes documentation only. No implementation tests, updater reproduction, native
installation, VM reset, service stop, release upload or publication was performed in this planning turn.

Environment observations:

- Parallels `Windows 11` running; ARM64 guest; SYSTEM and `--current-user` execution verified. Current
  user is `trg`. x64 Bun and Node tool directories located; their pinned versions still need checking.
- Lima `magnitude-ci` running on VZ, Ubuntu 22.04.5 aarch64, user systemd and sudo available. Port 10100
  occupied. Repository mounted read-only. Lima binary located in `specs/26-09-10/linux-vm/toolchain/bin`.
- `tom@sparky` reachable, Ubuntu 24.04.4 aarch64 with NVIDIA GB10, user systemd running. Existing
  checkout has a modified inference submodule. Use a new checkout; no changes made remotely.
- Existing CI provides x64 OS lanes and hosted/signed acceptance infrastructure. Access to required
  credentials/runners and RPM/macOS-x64 runtime coverage remain to be verified.

## Phase ledger

Planning amendment: existing-product regression is a mandatory lane. The full plan now assigns R1–R6
real desktop scenarios and a desktop-owned CLI lane to the relevant checkpoints. Native computer use
and visual inspection on Mac/visible VM desktops complement automated API and process assertions.
This amendment defines future tests; it does not claim those UI scenarios have already been run.

## Required entry for every implementation checkpoint

- Commit identity and changed behavior; record the parent source identity used for test builds.
- Exact commands, runtime/compiler/OS/architecture and artifact hashes/versions.
- Passing scenarios; failed scenarios with diagnosis; skipped scenarios and missing infrastructure.
- Desktop R1–R6 scenarios applicable to this phase, desktop-owned CLI results, and visual interaction
  evidence; explicitly identify VM GUI coverage that was not exercised.
- Evidence directory/CI receipt and owned-resource cleanup result.
- Decisions resolved (particularly Phase 2) and remaining gates affecting later phases.
- Next phase and its entry prerequisites.

Do not mark a phase passed while its required native evidence is missing. Commit independently
complete improvements if an external gate blocks other work; clearly retain the blocked gate here.

## Baseline execution, 2026-09-23

Working source: planning checkpoint `6342a59d`; product source unchanged from `772cfacb`.

- `bun packages/version/scripts/generate-version.ts` and
  `bun packages/daemon-management/scripts/build-native.ts` passed on macOS arm64.
- From `packages/daemon-management`, `bunx --bun vitest run`: 35 files passed,
  252 tests passed, 7 platform/optional tests skipped.
- `bunx --bun vitest run --config desktop/vitest.config.ts`: 30 files passed,
  1 failed, 3 skipped; 254 tests passed, 1 failed, 5 skipped. The existing shell environment
  descendant-retirement test fails because its PID fixture file is absent. An isolated rerun
  reproduces this failure; diagnosis is pending. This is not a passing regression baseline.
- Windows 11 ARM64 guest, ordinary user, existing x64 native adapter and Bun 1.3.14:
  a disposable directory created with ordinary mkdir and mode 0700 inherited permissions;
  native private-directory preparation rejected it with the reported error. Direct native
  creation and repeated preparation succeeded with the explicit protected user-only ACL.
  The disposable reproduction directory was removed. This confirms the primitive failure,
  not the complete download/install path or acceptance of the eventual fix. Current pinned
  runtime and freshly built adapter remain required for acceptance.
- Local logs: `/tmp/magnitude-headless-native-baseline.log`,
  `/tmp/magnitude-headless-desktop-baseline.log`, `/tmp/magnitude-headless-shell-baseline.log`.
  Real desktop interaction, desktop-owned CLI, and packaged upgrade gates remain pending.

## Windows preparation checkpoint, 2026-09-23

Parent: `6342a59d`. This checkpoint implements separate transfer scratch storage, narrow native
recovery of inherited Windows update caches, actionable refusal, and regression coverage. Generic
private-file validation is unchanged. Retired caches are preserved; recovery never adopts their
prepared records or executable bytes. Hosted acceptance now uses current configuration paths and
begins with an inherited cache.

Executed verification:

- Pinned Bun 1.4.2 (`744846f84`) downloaded into isolated tool directories on Mac and Windows;
  the first baseline runs used the previously installed Bun 1.3.14. No global runtime was replaced.
- Windows 11 build 26200, ARM64 guest with x64 execution, ordinary user. Compiled the native
  security acceptance executable with MSVC `/W4 /WX /O2 /std:c11`; it passed private creation,
  inherited-cache recovery, unknown-file preservation, broad-ACL refusal, and repeat recovery.
- Built the full Windows native addon with the repository build script. Node 24.21.0 and Bun
  1.4.2 both passed the new root/child junction refusal fixture, including unrelated-file preservation.
- In an isolated Windows checkout, `bun x --bun vitest run --config desktop/vitest.config.ts
  desktop/src/windows-update-source.test.ts desktop/src/hosted-update-source.test.ts`: 5 passed.
  Staging uses real native ACL operations for fresh and inherited profiles and rejects corrupt or
  unverified installer fixtures. The transfer test substitutes HTTP transport; it does not prove
  hosted release delivery or actual publisher verification.
- Windows `prepared-update.test.ts`: 6 passed, including interrupted-transfer cleanup.
- macOS arm64, pinned Bun: daemon-management full suite 252 passed, 7 skipped; desktop suite with
  `--exclude '**/shell-env.test.ts'` 249 passed, 6 skipped. Targeted daemon-management and desktop
  typechecks passed with existing diagnostic notices. `git diff --check` passed.
- The pre-existing shell test passes alone but fails after earlier tests with a protected-command
  lifetime-channel connection failure before the fixture writes its PID file. It also fails on
  pinned Bun; the full desktop gate remains unresolved. Temporary diagnostic changes were removed.

Windows artifacts in the isolated `MagnitudeTesting/headless-03a20624-69c4-4ad9-9501-8e2236452b6a`
directory:

- `desktop-host.node` SHA256 `fb336e907f23d1a568cfc1b93de1d428d997892030c9157bfdaa45e1c2b70433`.
- `windows-security-test.exe` SHA256 `748d9061448dc2364e5f2e3fba6b35c9958934e3a25987b18dab0cdc7e36a548`.

Disposable ACL/staging/junction fixtures cleaned themselves up. The isolated checkout, toolchains,
and build artifacts are retained for subsequent phases. No installed application or user profile
was modified, and no release was published. Logs remain under `/tmp/magnitude-headless-*` on Mac.

Pending: signed hosted download and two successive installed upgrades, cancellation/interruption
and rename-race acceptance, native x64 Windows lane, desktop R1–R6/desktop-owned CLI/visual gates.
Phase 1's implementation checkpoint does not claim those broader acceptance gates have passed.
Next: foreground startup continuation/admission proof, alongside completion of baseline GUI and
process-channel regression work.
