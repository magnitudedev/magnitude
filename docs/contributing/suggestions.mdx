There are a couple ways to share feedback or suggestions for Magnitude.

**1. Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/VcdpMh9tTy)**

Our Discord community frequently gives us feedback on how test cases are running or what features they are missing, which enables us to improve it.

**2. Create a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/magnitudedev/magnitude/issues)**

Another way to bring an issue or feature request to our attention is to create a GitHub issue. We check these often!

**3. Create a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/magnitudedev/magnitude/discussions/categories/ideas)**

For feature suggestions that are more abstract or need brainstorming, feel free to create a discussion instead of an issue to engage with us and others in the community.
