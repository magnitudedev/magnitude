## Prerequisites

### Bun

While not explicitly required, it's recommended to use [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as your node runtime since that's what our team uses.

To install bun:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Linux & macOS">
  ```sh
  curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
  ```powershell
  powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>All other contribution-related docs will refer to `bun` in commands - but you can replace with `npm` if preferred</Info>

## Monorepo Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/magnitudedev/magnitude.git
```

Since the initial install will fail due to the missing (unbuilt) dependency `magnitude-core`, do this:

```sh
bun i && bun run build && bun i
```

The monorepo now has dependencies installed and is built.

## Building Packages

Whenever you make a change to `magnitude-core` that you want to be reflected in `magnitude-test` during testing, make sure to rebuild with `bun run build`.

## Local Testing

When you make changes to `magnitude-test` that you want to test in your project or elsewhere, you need a way to refer to your local package.

To do this, you can use [yalc](https://github.com/wclr/yalc).

Install yalc:
```sh
bun i -g yalc
```

In your other project:
```sh
yalc add magnitude-test
```
This will add the yalc (local) version of magnitude-test instead of the one published on npm

Then back in the monorepo:
```sh
cd packages/magnitude-test
bun run pubdev
```
This will update your other project with your modified version of Magnitude
