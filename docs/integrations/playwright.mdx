Magnitude runs tests using Playwright. While `ai.step()` and `ai.check()` cover most test automation needs with natural language, direct access to Playwright's `page` and `context` objects is available within test functions (`async ({ ai, page, context }) => { ... }`).

Use `page` and `context` strategically when these specific capabilities are needed, or as a fallback if the AI struggles with a complex interaction. Refer to the [Playwright Access reference](../reference/playwright-access) for basic API details.

<Note>
Magnitude aims to expand the capabilities of the `ai` agent over time to cover more scenarios natively. However, direct access to Playwright's API ensures you always have the tools needed for any testing requirement in the meantime.
</Note>

## Example

```typescript
import { test } from 'magnitude-test';

const mockProfileData = { userId: 'user123', notificationsEnabled: true };

test('can see correct user settings', async ({ ai, page, context }) => {
  // Inject some authorization cookies directly with browser context
  await context.addCookies([{ name: 'session_id', value: 'fake-session-token', domain: 'localhost', path: '/' }]);
  
  // Mock the settings API
  await page.route('**/api/user/settings', async route => {
    await route.fulfill({ status: 200, contentType: 'application/json', body: JSON.stringify(mockProfileData) });
  });

  await ai.step("Navigate to the user settings page");
  await ai.check("Shows user ID 'user123'");
  await ai.check("Notifications are enabled");
});
```

By combining Magnitude's AI-driven steps with direct Playwright access for these specific scenarios, you can create comprehensive and robust tests.
