To run your Magnitude test cases, use the CLI:
```
npx magnitude
```

## Test in Parallel
You can run your Magnitude tests in parallel simply by providing the `--workers` or `-w` flag with the desired number of parallel workers:

```
npx magnitude -w 4
```

If any Magnitude test fails, the CLI process will exit with status code 1. When deployed as part of a CI/CD pipeline e.g. with a GitHub Action, this will fail the deployment.

## Test Failures

Unlike existing frameworks like Playwright, the criteria for test case failure is not based on whether a selector fails or some expression evaluates false.

Instead, Magnitude decides to fail a test case if either **(1) any step cannot be completed** or **(2) a check does not hold true**.

It will attempt to execute a test case according to the provided steps and only fail if there is no clear way to accomplish the test case, or if any check isn't satisfied.


## Integrating with CI/CD
You can run Magnitude tests in CI anywhere that you could run Playwright tests, just include LLM client credentials.
For instructions on running tests cases on GitHub actions, see [here](/integrations/github-actions).
