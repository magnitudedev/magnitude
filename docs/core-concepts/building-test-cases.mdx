## Test Cases

Each Magnitude test case navigates to a URL in a browser, executes **Test Steps** on the web application at that URL, and verifies any **Checks** along the way.

For example:
```typescript
test('can add and remove todos')
    .step('Add a todo')
    .step('Remove the todo')
```

<Info>A test case is designed to represent a single user flow in your web app.</Info>


### Configure Test Cases

Each test can additionally be configured with a different starting URL (defaults to the [configured project](/customization/configuration) `url` in `magnitude.config.ts`):

```typescript
test('can add and remove todos', { url: "https://mytodoapp.com" })
    .step('Add a todo')
    .step('Remove the todo')
```

## Test Steps

When you define a step, you provide a description for what Magnitude should do during that step, for example:
```typescript
test('example')
    .step('Log in') // step description
```
Each step should make sense on its own and describe a portion of the user flow.

Steps should only be specific enough that it's clear from your app's interface how to complete the step. For example - to log into an app, you don't need to say type into each field or what buttons to press - just provide any necessary data and say "Log in".

### Checks

A **check** is a **natural language visual assertion** that you can add to any step in your test case.

<Info>Think `assert` in other testing frameworks, except it can "see" the website and understand natural language descriptions.</Info>

Examples of valid checks:
- "Only 3 todos should be listed"
- "Make sure image of giraffe is visible"
- "The response from the chat bot should make sense and answer the user's question"

<Info>Checks are validated after the step they are attached to is executed.</Info>

To actually use a check in a test case, chain it to a `step` like this:
```typescript
test('example')
    .step('Log in')
        .check('Dashboard is visible')
```

### Test Data

You can provide additional **test data** relevant to specific step like this:

```typescript
test('example')
    .step('Log in')
        .data({ email: "foo@bar.com", password: "foo" })
        .check('Dashboard is visible')
```

<Info>The key/value pairs are completely up to you, but it should be clear enough what they should be used for.</Info>

You can also provide completely freeform data by passing in a string instead of a key/value object:
```typescript
test('example')
    .step('Add 3 todos')
        .data('Use "Take out trash" for the first todo and make up the other 2')
```

### Example of migrating a Playwright test case to Magnitude

A simple test case from the Playwright demo TODO app:
```typescript  
test('should allow me to add todo items', async ({ page }) => {
    const newTodo = page.getByPlaceholder('What needs to be done?');

    await newTodo.fill(TODO_ITEMS[0]);
    await newTodo.press('Enter');

    await expect(page.getByTestId('todo-title')).toHaveText([
        TODO_ITEMS[0]
    ]);

    await newTodo.fill(TODO_ITEMS[1]);
    await newTodo.press('Enter');

    await expect(page.getByTestId('todo-title')).toHaveText([
        TODO_ITEMS[0],
        TODO_ITEMS[1]
    ]);
  });
```

The same test case in Magnitude:
```typescript
test('should allow me to add todo items')
    .step('Create todo')
        .data(TODO_ITEMS[0])
        .check('First todo appears in list')
    .step('Create another todo')
        .data(TODO_ITEMS[1])
        .check('List has two todos')
```
