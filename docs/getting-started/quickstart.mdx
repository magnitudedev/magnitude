## Get Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Setup a new project">
    ```sh
    npx create-magnitude-app
    ```
    This script will create a project from a starter template based on your preferences. Simply follow the instructions to set up your project and configure an LLM.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the example">
    ```sh
    cd my-project
    npm start
    ```
    This will kick off a basic example included in the template that shows you a bit of what Magnitude can do.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make some changes">
    Trying tweaking one of the `act()` calls, run `npm start` again, and see what happens - or replace the URL and try an automation on a completely different site.
  </Step>
</Steps>
