## Setup


**Install our test runner** in the node project you want to test (or see our [demo repo](https://github.com/magnitudedev/magnitude-demo-repo) if you don't have a project to try it on)
```sh
npm install --save-dev magnitude-test
```

**Initialize Magnitude** in your project by running:
```sh
npx magnitude init
```
This will create a basic tests directory `tests/magnitude` with:
- `magnitude.config.ts`: Magnitude test configuration file
- `example.mag.ts`: An example test file

### Configure LLMs

Magnitude requires setting up two LLM clients:
1. üß† A strong general multi-modal LLM (the **"planner"**)
2. üëÅÔ∏è A fast vision LLM with pixel-precision (the **"executor"**)

#### Planner Configuration

For the **planner**, you can use models like Gemini 2.5 pro, Claude Sonnet 3.7, GPT 4.1, or any other model that accepts image input.

Magnitude will automatically read and use any of the following API keys if configured:
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` (Google AI Studio `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25`)
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (OpenRouter `google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25`)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (Anthropic `claude-3-7-sonnet-latest`)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` (OpenAI `gpt-4.1-2025-04-14`)

If you have any of these in your environment, no additional setup is needed for the planner. To explicitly select a specific provider and model, see [configuration](https://docs.magnitude.run/reference/llm-configuration). Currently we support Google Vertex AI, Anthropic, AWS Bedrock, OpenAI, and OpenAI-compatible providers.

<Info> We strongly recommend Gemini 2.5 pro or Sonnet 3.5/3.7 for the planner model. We design the planner agent with the strongest models in mind, so other models may not work as expected.</Info>

#### Executor Configuration (Moondream)

Currently for the **executor** model, we only support [Moondream](https://moondream.ai/), which is a fast vision model that Magnitude uses for precise UI interactions.

To configure Moondream, sign up and create an API with Moondream [here](https://moondream.ai/c/cloud/api-keys), then add to your environment as `MOONDREAM_API_KEY`. This will use the cloud version, which includes 5,000 free requests per day (roughly a few hundred test cases in Magnitude). Moondream is fully open source and self-hostable as well.

üöÄ Once you've got your LLMs set up, you're ready to run tests!


## Running tests

**Run your Magnitude tests with:**
```sh
npx magnitude
```

This will run all Magnitude test files discovered with the `*.mag.ts` pattern. If the agent finds a problem with your app, it will tell you what happened and describe the bug!

> To run many tests in parallel, add `-w <workers>`

To learn more about different options for running tests see [here](/core-concepts/running-tests).


## Building test cases

Now that you've got Magnitude set up, you can create real test cases for your app. Here's an example for a general idea:
```ts
import { test } from 'magnitude-test';

test('can log in and create company', async ({ ai }) => {
    await ai.step('Log in to the app', { data: {
        username: 'test-user@magnitude.run',
        password: 'test'
    }});
    await ai.check('Can see dashboard');
    await ai.step('Create a new company', {
        data: 'Make up the first 2 values and use defaults for the rest'
    });
    await ai.check('Company added successfully');
});
```

Steps, checks, and data are all natural language. Think of it like you're describing how to test a particular flow to a co-worker - what steps they need to take, what they should check for, and what test data to use.
