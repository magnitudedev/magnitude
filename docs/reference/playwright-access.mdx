title: Playwright Access
description: "Reference for accessing Playwright's `Page` and `BrowserContext` objects within Magnitude tests."
---

Magnitude tests execute using Playwright under the hood. For advanced use cases or when you need direct control over the browser beyond what the `ai` object provides, Magnitude exposes the underlying Playwright `Page` and `BrowserContext` objects within the test function context.

<RequestExample>
```typescript Playwright Usage Example
import { test } from 'magnitude-test';
import { expect } from '@playwright/test'; // Import Playwright assertions if needed

test('Direct Playwright Interaction', async ({ ai, page, context }) => {
  // Use Magnitude AI for high-level steps
  await ai.step("Navigate to the product page");

  // Use Playwright 'page' object for specific checks or actions
  const pageTitle = await page.title();
  expect(pageTitle).toContain('Product Details');

  const specificElement = page.locator('#special-offer-banner');
  await expect(specificElement).toBeVisible();

  // 'context' can be used for browser-level operations (cookies, permissions, etc.)
  const cookies = await context.cookies();
  console.log('Current cookies:', cookies);
});
```
</RequestExample>

## Test Function Context

The `testFn` passed to the `test` function receives a context object:

```typescript
({ ai, page, context }) => Promise<void>
```

<ResponseField name="ai" type="Magnus" required>
  The interface for Magnitude's AI capabilities. See [AI Steps and Checks](./ai-steps-checks) and [Low-Level AI Actions](./ai-low-level).
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="page" type="Page" required>
  The standard Playwright [`Page`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page) object corresponding to the current browser tab. You can call any methods available on the Playwright `Page` API directly on this object.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="context" type="BrowserContext" required>
  The standard Playwright [`BrowserContext`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsercontext) object for the current browser session. Use this for context-level operations like managing cookies, permissions, or opening new pages.
</ResponseField>

<Note>
While direct Playwright access offers maximum flexibility, prefer using the `ai.step()` and `ai.check()` methods for most interactions. This keeps tests more readable, maintainable, and leverages Magnitude's AI capabilities for resilience. Use `page` and `context` when specific Playwright functionality is required that isn't covered by the `ai` object.
</Note>

Refer to the official [Playwright Documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page) for the full API available on the `page` and `context` objects.
