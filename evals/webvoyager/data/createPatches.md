Given these web tasks that are evaluated as part of a benchmark for web LLM agents, consider any patches that need to be applied in order to adjust for recency.

Keep in mind that the original benchmark was created March 2, 2024.

Today is June 26, 2025.

For tasks where dates in the task are affected by today's date, or require a future date, they should be adjusted so that they are affectively similar in difficulty/feasibility as if today was March 2, 2024 in the original task set.

Any product information or things that have changed over time should be appropriately adjusted to have modern equivalents.

Do not patch any wording or phrasing unless its directly for the purpose of adjusting for dates/time/temporal feasibility.

Consider each task carefully, and output any required patches in this format:

{
    "task--id": {
        "reason": "justification for making the patch",
        "prev": "full original task",
        "new": "full adjusted task",
    }
}
