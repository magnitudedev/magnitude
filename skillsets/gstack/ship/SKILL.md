  Ship workflow: detect + merge base branch, run tests, review diff, bump VERSION,
  update CHANGELOG, commit, push, create PR. Use when asked to "ship", "deploy",
  "push to main", "create a PR", "merge and push", or "get it deployed".
  Proactively invoke this skill (do NOT push/PR directly) when the user says code
  is ready, asks about deploying, wants to push code up, or asks to create a PR.
---

## Step 0: Detect platform and base branch

First, detect the git hosting platform from the remote URL:

```bash
git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null
```

- If the URL contains "github.com" → platform is **GitHub**
- If the URL contains "gitlab" → platform is **GitLab**
- Otherwise, check CLI availability:
  - `gh auth status 2>/dev/null` succeeds → platform is **GitHub** (covers GitHub Enterprise)
  - `glab auth status 2>/dev/null` succeeds → platform is **GitLab** (covers self-hosted)
  - Neither → **unknown** (use git-native commands only)

Determine which branch this PR/MR targets, or the repo's default branch if no
PR/MR exists. Use the result as "the base branch" in all subsequent steps.

**If GitHub:**
1. `gh pr view --json baseRefName -q .baseRefName` — if succeeds, use it
2. `gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name` — if succeeds, use it

**If GitLab:**
1. `glab mr view -F json 2>/dev/null` and extract the `target_branch` field — if succeeds, use it
2. `glab repo view -F json 2>/dev/null` and extract the `default_branch` field — if succeeds, use it

**Git-native fallback (if unknown platform, or CLI commands fail):**
1. `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's|refs/remotes/origin/||'`
2. If that fails: `git rev-parse --verify origin/main 2>/dev/null` → use `main`
3. If that fails: `git rev-parse --verify origin/master 2>/dev/null` → use `master`

If all fail, fall back to `main`.

Print the detected base branch name. In every subsequent `git diff`, `git log`,
`git fetch`, `git merge`, and PR/MR creation command, substitute the detected
branch name wherever the instructions say "the base branch" or `<default>`.

# Ship: Fully Automated Ship Workflow

You are running the `/ship` workflow. This is a **non-interactive, fully automated** workflow. Do NOT ask for confirmation at any step. The user said `/ship` which means DO IT. Run straight through and output the PR URL at the end.

**Only stop for:**
- On the base branch (abort)
- Merge conflicts that can't be auto-resolved (stop, show conflicts)
- In-branch test failures (pre-existing failures are triaged, not auto-blocking)
- Pre-landing review finds ASK items that need user judgment
- MINOR or MAJOR version bump needed (ask — see Step 4)
- AI-assessed coverage below minimum threshold (hard gate with user override — see Step 3.4)
- Plan items NOT DONE with no user override (see Step 3.45)
- Plan verification failures (see Step 3.47)

**Never stop for:**
- Uncommitted changes (always include them)
- Version bump choice (auto-pick MICRO or PATCH — see Step 4)
- CHANGELOG content (auto-generate from diff)
- Commit message approval (auto-commit)
- Multi-file changesets (auto-split into bisectable commits)
- Auto-fixable review findings (dead code, N+1, stale comments — fixed automatically)
- Test coverage gaps within target threshold (auto-generate and commit, or flag in PR body)

**Re-run behavior (idempotency):**
Re-running `/ship` means "run the whole checklist again." Every verification step
(tests, coverage audit, plan completion, pre-landing review, adversarial review,
VERSION/CHANGELOG check, document-release) runs on every invocation.
Only *actions* are idempotent:
- Step 4: If VERSION already bumped, skip the bump but still read the version
- Step 7: If already pushed, skip the push command
- Step 8: If PR exists, update the body instead of creating a new PR
Never skip a verification step because a prior `/ship` run already performed it.

---

## Step 1: Pre-flight

1. Check the current branch. If on the base branch or the repo's default branch, **abort**: "You're on the base branch. Ship from a feature branch."

2. Run `git status` (never use `-uall`). Uncommitted changes are always included — no need to ask.

3. Run `git diff <base>...HEAD --stat` and `git log <base>..HEAD --oneline` to understand what's being shipped.

4. Check review readiness:

Check `$M/reports/` for any review reports from this session. If review reports exist, summarize what was found. If none exist, note: "No prior review found — ship will run its own pre-landing review in Step 3.5."

Check diff size: `git diff <base>...HEAD --stat | tail -1`. For large diffs (200+ lines), suggest running a dedicated review skill before shipping.

Continue to Step 1.5 — do NOT block or ask. Ship runs its own review in Step 3.5.

---

## Step 1.5: Distribution Pipeline Check

If the diff introduces a new standalone artifact (CLI binary, library package, tool) — not a web
service with existing deployment — verify that a distribution pipeline exists.

1. Check if the diff adds a new `cmd/` directory, `main.go`, or `bin/` entry point:
   ```bash
   git diff origin/<base> --name-only | grep -E '(cmd/.*/main\.go|bin/|Cargo\.toml|setup\.py|package\.json)' | head -5
   ```

2. If new artifact detected, check for a release workflow:
   ```bash
   ls .github/workflows/ 2>/dev/null | grep -iE 'release|publish|dist'
   grep -qE 'release|publish|deploy' .gitlab-ci.yml 2>/dev/null && echo "GITLAB_CI_RELEASE"
   ```

3. **If no release pipeline exists and a new artifact was added:** Ask the user: "This PR adds a new binary/tool but there's no CI/CD pipeline to build and publish it. Users won't be able to download the artifact after merge. Options: A) Add a release workflow now, B) Defer — note it for later, C) Not needed — this is internal/web-only."

4. **If release pipeline exists:** Continue silently.
5. **If no new artifact detected:** Skip silently.

---

## Step 2: Merge the base branch (BEFORE tests)

Fetch and merge the base branch into the feature branch so tests run against the merged state:

```bash
git fetch origin <base> && git merge origin/<base> --no-edit
```

**If there are merge conflicts:** Try to auto-resolve if they are simple (VERSION, schema.rb, CHANGELOG ordering). If conflicts are complex or ambiguous, **STOP** and show them.

**If already up to date:** Continue silently.

---

## Step 2.5: Test Framework Bootstrap

## Test Framework Bootstrap

**Detect existing test framework and project runtime:**

```bash
setopt +o nomatch 2>/dev/null || true  # zsh compat
# Detect project runtime
[ -f Gemfile ] && echo "RUNTIME:ruby"
[ -f package.json ] && echo "RUNTIME:node"
[ -f requirements.txt ] || [ -f pyproject.toml ] && echo "RUNTIME:python"
[ -f go.mod ] && echo "RUNTIME:go"
[ -f Cargo.toml ] && echo "RUNTIME:rust"
[ -f composer.json ] && echo "RUNTIME:php"
[ -f mix.exs ] && echo "RUNTIME:elixir"
# Detect sub-frameworks
[ -f Gemfile ] && grep -q "rails" Gemfile 2>/dev/null && echo "FRAMEWORK:rails"
[ -f package.json ] && grep -q '"next"' package.json 2>/dev/null && echo "FRAMEWORK:nextjs"
# Check for existing test infrastructure
ls jest.config.* vitest.config.* playwright.config.* .rspec pytest.ini pyproject.toml phpunit.xml 2>/dev/null
ls -d test/ tests/ spec/ __tests__/ cypress/ e2e/ 2>/dev/null
# Check opt-out marker
[ -f .qa-no-test-bootstrap ] && echo "BOOTSTRAP_DECLINED"
```

**If test framework detected** (config files or test directories found):
Print "Test framework detected: {name} ({N} existing tests). Skipping bootstrap."
Read 2-3 existing test files to learn conventions (naming, imports, assertion style, setup patterns).
Store conventions as prose context for use in Phase 8e.5 or Step 3.4. **Skip the rest of bootstrap.**

**If BOOTSTRAP_DECLINED** appears: Print "Test bootstrap previously declined — skipping." **Skip the rest of bootstrap.**

**If NO runtime detected** (no config files found): Ask the user what runtime they're using. Options: A) Node.js/TypeScript B) Ruby/Rails C) Python D) Go E) Rust F) PHP G) Elixir H) This project doesn't need tests.
If user picks H → write `.qa-no-test-bootstrap` and continue without tests.

**If runtime detected but no test framework — bootstrap:**

### B2. Research best practices

Use WebSearch to find current best practices for the detected runtime:
- `"[runtime] best test framework 2025 2026"`
- `"[framework A] vs [framework B] comparison"`

If WebSearch is unavailable, use this built-in knowledge table:

| Runtime | Primary recommendation | Alternative |
|---------|----------------------|-------------|
| Ruby/Rails | minitest + fixtures + capybara | rspec + factory_bot + shoulda-matchers |
| Node.js | vitest + @testing-library | jest + @testing-library |
| Next.js | vitest + @testing-library/react + playwright | jest + cypress |
| Python | pytest + pytest-cov | unittest |
| Go | stdlib testing + testify | stdlib only |
| Rust | cargo test (built-in) + mockall | — |
| PHP | phpunit + mockery | pest |
| Elixir | ExUnit (built-in) + ex_machina | — |

### B3. Framework selection

Ask the user which test framework to set up: "I detected this is a [Runtime/Framework] project with no test framework. Options: A) [Primary] — [rationale], B) [Alternative] — [rationale], C) Skip — don't set up testing right now."

If user picks C → write `.qa-no-test-bootstrap`. Tell user: "If you change your mind later, delete `.qa-no-test-bootstrap` and re-run." Continue without tests.

If multiple runtimes detected (monorepo) → ask which runtime to set up first, with option to do both sequentially.

### B4. Install and configure

1. Install the chosen packages (npm/bun/gem/pip/etc.)
2. Create minimal config file
3. Create directory structure (test/, spec/, etc.)
4. Create one example test matching the project's code to verify setup works

If package installation fails → debug once. If still failing → revert with `git checkout -- package.json package-lock.json` (or equivalent for the runtime). Warn user and continue without tests.

### B4.5. First real tests

Generate 3-5 real tests for existing code:

1. **Find recently changed files:** `git log --since=30.days --name-only --format="" | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -10`
2. **Prioritize by risk:** Error handlers > business logic with conditionals > API endpoints > pure functions
3. **For each file:** Write one test that tests real behavior with meaningful assertions. Never `expect(x).toBeDefined()` — test what the code DOES.
4. Run each test. Passes → keep. Fails → fix once. Still fails → delete silently.
5. Generate at least 1 test, cap at 5.

Never import secrets, API keys, or credentials in test files. Use environment variables or test fixtures.

### B5. Verify

```bash
# Run the full test suite to confirm everything works
{detected test command}
```

If tests fail → debug once. If still failing → revert all bootstrap changes and warn user.

### B5.5. CI/CD pipeline

```bash
# Check CI provider
ls -d .github/ 2>/dev/null && echo "CI:github"
ls .gitlab-ci.yml .circleci/ bitrise.yml 2>/dev/null
```

If `.github/` exists (or no CI detected — default to GitHub Actions):
Create `.github/workflows/test.yml` with:
- `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`
- Appropriate setup action for the runtime (setup-node, setup-ruby, setup-python, etc.)
- The same test command verified in B5
- Trigger: push + pull_request

If non-GitHub CI detected → skip CI generation with note: "Detected {provider} — CI pipeline generation supports GitHub Actions only. Add test step to your existing pipeline manually."

### B6. Create TESTING.md

First check: If TESTING.md already exists → read it and update/append rather than overwriting. Never destroy existing content.

Write TESTING.md with:
- Philosophy: "100% test coverage is the key to great vibe coding. Tests let you move fast, trust your instincts, and ship with confidence — without them, vibe coding is just yolo coding. With tests, it's a superpower."
- Framework name and version
- How to run tests (the verified command from B5)
- Test layers: Unit tests (what, where, when), Integration tests, Smoke tests, E2E tests
- Conventions: file naming, assertion style, setup/teardown patterns

### B7. Update AGENTS.md

First check: If AGENTS.md already has a `## Testing` section → skip. Don't duplicate.

Append a `## Testing` section:
- Run command and test directory
- Reference to TESTING.md
- Test expectations:
  - 100% test coverage is the goal — tests make vibe coding safe
  - When writing new functions, write a corresponding test
  - When fixing a bug, write a regression test
  - When adding error handling, write a test that triggers the error
  - When adding a conditional (if/else, switch), write tests for BOTH paths
  - Never commit code that makes existing tests fail

### B8. Commit

```bash
git status --porcelain
```

Only commit if there are changes. Stage all bootstrap files (config, test directory, TESTING.md, AGENTS.md, .github/workflows/test.yml if created):
`git commit -m "chore: bootstrap test framework ({framework name})"`

---

---

## Step 3: Run tests (on merged code)

Run both test suites in parallel:

```bash
{primary test command} 2>&1 | tee /tmp/ship_tests.txt &
{secondary test command, if any} 2>&1 | tee /tmp/ship_tests2.txt &
wait
```

After both complete, read the output files and check pass/fail.

**If any test fails:** Do NOT immediately stop. Apply the Test Failure Ownership Triage:

## Test Failure Ownership Triage

When tests fail, do NOT immediately stop. First, determine ownership:

### Step T1: Classify each failure

For each failing test:

1. **Get the files changed on this branch:**
   ```bash
   git diff origin/<base>...HEAD --name-only
   ```

2. **Classify the failure:**
   - **In-branch** if: the failing test file itself was modified on this branch, OR the test output references code that was changed on this branch, OR you can trace the failure to a change in the branch diff.
   - **Likely pre-existing** if: neither the test file nor the code it tests was modified on this branch, AND the failure is unrelated to any branch change you can identify.
   - **When ambiguous, default to in-branch.** It is safer to stop the developer than to let a broken test ship. Only classify as pre-existing when you are confident.

   This classification is heuristic — use your judgment reading the diff and the test output. You do not have a programmatic dependency graph.

### Step T2: Handle in-branch failures

**STOP.** These are your failures. Show them and do not proceed. The developer must fix their own broken tests before shipping.

### Step T3: Handle pre-existing failures

Check `REPO_MODE` from the preamble output.

**If REPO_MODE is `solo`:**

Ask the user:

> These test failures appear pre-existing (not caused by your branch changes):
>
> [list each failure with file:line and brief error description]
>
> Options:
> A) Investigate and fix now
> B) Note for later and continue
> C) Skip — ship anyway

**If REPO_MODE is `collaborative` or `unknown`:**

Ask the user:

> These test failures appear pre-existing (not caused by your branch changes):
>
> [list each failure with file:line and brief error description]
>
> Options:
> A) Investigate and fix now
> B) Blame + assign GitHub issue to the author
> C) Note for later and continue
> D) Skip — ship anyway

### Step T4: Execute the chosen action

**If "Investigate and fix now":**
- Switch to /investigate mindset: root cause first, then minimal fix.
- Fix the pre-existing failure.
- Commit the fix separately from the branch's changes: `git commit -m "fix: pre-existing test failure in <test-file>"`
- Continue with the workflow.

**If "Note for later":**
- Note the failure in `$M/reports/ship-preexisting-failures.md` and continue.
- Continue with the workflow — treat the pre-existing failure as non-blocking.

**If "Blame + assign GitHub issue" (collaborative only):**
- Find who likely broke it. Check BOTH the test file AND the production code it tests:
  ```bash
  # Who last touched the failing test?
  git log --format="%an (%ae)" -1 -- <failing-test-file>
  # Who last touched the production code the test covers? (often the actual breaker)
  git log --format="%an (%ae)" -1 -- <source-file-under-test>
  ```
  If these are different people, prefer the production code author — they likely introduced the regression.
- Create an issue assigned to that person (use the platform detected in Step 0):
  - **If GitHub:**
    ```bash
    gh issue create \
      --title "Pre-existing test failure: <test-name>" \
      --body "Found failing on branch <current-branch>. Failure is pre-existing.\n\n**Error:**\n```\n<first 10 lines>\n```\n\n**Last modified by:** <author>" \
      --assignee "<github-username>"
    ```
  - **If GitLab:**
    ```bash
    glab issue create \
      -t "Pre-existing test failure: <test-name>" \
      -d "Found failing on branch <current-branch>. Failure is pre-existing.\n\n**Error:**\n```\n<first 10 lines>\n```\n\n**Last modified by:** <author>" \
      -a "<gitlab-username>"
    ```
- If neither CLI is available or `--assignee`/`-a` fails (user not in org, etc.), create the issue without assignee and note who should look at it in the body.
- Continue with the workflow.

**If "Skip":**
- Continue with the workflow.
- Note in output: "Pre-existing test failure skipped: <test-name>"

**After triage:** If any in-branch failures remain unfixed, **STOP**. Do not proceed. If all failures were pre-existing and handled (fixed, TODOed, assigned, or skipped), continue to Step 3.25.

**If all pass:** Continue silently — just note the counts briefly.

---

## Step 3.25: Eval Suites (conditional)

Evals are mandatory when prompt-related files change. Skip this step entirely if no prompt files are in the diff.

**1. Check if the diff touches prompt-related files:**

```bash
git diff origin/<base> --name-only
```

Match against these patterns (from project configuration):
- `app/services/*_prompt_builder.rb`
- `app/services/*_generation_service.rb`, `*_writer_service.rb`, `*_designer_service.rb`
- `app/services/*_evaluator.rb`, `*_scorer.rb`, `*_classifier_service.rb`, `*_analyzer.rb`
- `app/services/concerns/*voice*.rb`, `*writing*.rb`, `*prompt*.rb`, `*token*.rb`
- `app/services/chat_tools/*.rb`, `app/services/x_thread_tools/*.rb`
- `config/system_prompts/*.txt`
- `test/evals/**/*` (eval infrastructure changes affect all suites)

**If no matches:** Print "No prompt-related files changed — skipping evals." and continue to Step 3.5.

**2. Identify affected eval suites:**

Each eval runner (`test/evals/*_eval_runner.rb`) declares `PROMPT_SOURCE_FILES` listing which source files affect it. Grep these to find which suites match the changed files:

```bash
grep -l "changed_file_basename" test/evals/*_eval_runner.rb
```

Map runner → test file: `post_generation_eval_runner.rb` → `post_generation_eval_test.rb`.

**Special cases:**
- Changes to `test/evals/judges/*.rb`, `test/evals/support/*.rb`, or `test/evals/fixtures/` affect ALL suites that use those judges/support files. Check imports in the eval test files to determine which.
- Changes to `config/system_prompts/*.txt` — grep eval runners for the prompt filename to find affected suites.
- If unsure which suites are affected, run ALL suites that could plausibly be impacted. Over-testing is better than missing a regression.

**3. Run affected suites at `EVAL_JUDGE_TIER=full`:**

`/ship` is a pre-merge gate, so always use full tier (Sonnet structural + Opus persona judges).

```bash
EVAL_JUDGE_TIER=full EVAL_VERBOSE=1 {eval test command} 2>&1 | tee /tmp/ship_evals.txt
```

If multiple suites need to run, run them sequentially (each needs a test lane). If the first suite fails, stop immediately — don't burn API cost on remaining suites.

**4. Check results:**

- **If any eval fails:** Show the failures, the cost dashboard, and **STOP**. Do not proceed.
- **If all pass:** Note pass counts and cost. Continue to Step 3.5.

**5. Save eval output** — include eval results and cost dashboard in the PR body (Step 8).

**Tier reference (for context — /ship always uses `full`):**
| Tier | When | Speed (cached) | Cost |
|------|------|----------------|------|
| `fast` (Haiku) | Dev iteration, smoke tests | ~5s (14x faster) | ~$0.07/run |
| `standard` (Sonnet) | Default dev, `bin/test-lane --eval` | ~17s (4x faster) | ~$0.37/run |
| `full` (Opus persona) | **`/ship` and pre-merge** | ~72s (baseline) | ~$1.27/run |

---

## Step 3.4: Test Coverage Audit

100% coverage is the goal — every untested path is a path where bugs hide and vibe coding becomes yolo coding. Evaluate what was ACTUALLY coded (from the diff), not what was planned.

### Test Framework Detection

Before analyzing coverage, detect the project's test framework:

1. **Check project configuration files** (e.g., `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, or any developer setup guide) — look for a testing section with test command and framework name. If found, use that as the authoritative source.
2. **If no testing section is found, auto-detect:**

```bash
setopt +o nomatch 2>/dev/null || true  # zsh compat
# Detect project runtime
[ -f Gemfile ] && echo "RUNTIME:ruby"
[ -f package.json ] && echo "RUNTIME:node"
[ -f requirements.txt ] || [ -f pyproject.toml ] && echo "RUNTIME:python"
[ -f go.mod ] && echo "RUNTIME:go"
[ -f Cargo.toml ] && echo "RUNTIME:rust"
# Check for existing test infrastructure
ls jest.config.* vitest.config.* playwright.config.* cypress.config.* .rspec pytest.ini phpunit.xml 2>/dev/null
ls -d test/ tests/ spec/ __tests__/ cypress/ e2e/ 2>/dev/null
```

3. **If no framework detected:** falls through to the Test Framework Bootstrap step (Step 2.5) which handles full setup.

**0. Before/after test count:**

```bash
# Count test files before any generation
find . -name '*.test.*' -o -name '*.spec.*' -o -name '*_test.*' -o -name '*_spec.*' | grep -v node_modules | wc -l
```

Store this number for the PR body.

**1. Trace every codepath changed** using `git diff origin/<base>...HEAD`:

Read every changed file. For each one, trace how data flows through the code — don't just list functions, actually follow the execution:

1. **Read the diff.** For each changed file, read the full file (not just the diff hunk) to understand context.
2. **Trace data flow.** Starting from each entry point (route handler, exported function, event listener, component render), follow the data through every branch:
   - Where does input come from? (request params, props, database, API call)
   - What transforms it? (validation, mapping, computation)
   - Where does it go? (database write, API response, rendered output, side effect)
   - What can go wrong at each step? (null/undefined, invalid input, network failure, empty collection)
3. **Diagram the execution.** For each changed file, draw an ASCII diagram showing:
   - Every function/method that was added or modified
   - Every conditional branch (if/else, switch, ternary, guard clause, early return)
   - Every error path (try/catch, rescue, error boundary, fallback)
   - Every call to another function (trace into it — does IT have untested branches?)
   - Every edge: what happens with null input? Empty array? Invalid type?

This is the critical step — you're building a map of every line of code that can execute differently based on input. Every branch in this diagram needs a test.

**2. Map user flows, interactions, and error states:**

Code coverage isn't enough — you need to cover how real users interact with the changed code. For each changed feature, think through:

- **User flows:** What sequence of actions does a user take that touches this code? Map the full journey (e.g., "user clicks 'Pay' → form validates → API call → success/failure screen"). Each step in the journey needs a test.
- **Interaction edge cases:** What happens when the user does something unexpected?
  - Double-click/rapid resubmit
  - Navigate away mid-operation (back button, close tab, click another link)
  - Submit with stale data (page sat open for 30 minutes, session expired)
  - Slow connection (API takes 10 seconds — what does the user see?)
  - Concurrent actions (two tabs, same form)
- **Error states the user can see:** For every error the code handles, what does the user actually experience?
  - Is there a clear error message or a silent failure?
  - Can the user recover (retry, go back, fix input) or are they stuck?
  - What happens with no network? With a 500 from the API? With invalid data from the server?
- **Empty/zero/boundary states:** What does the UI show with zero results? With 10,000 results? With a single character input? With maximum-length input?

Add these to your diagram alongside the code branches. A user flow with no test is just as much a gap as an untested if/else.

**3. Check each branch against existing tests:**

Go through your diagram branch by branch — both code paths AND user flows. For each one, search for a test that exercises it:
- Function `processPayment()` → look for `billing.test.ts`, `billing.spec.ts`, `test/billing_test.rb`
- An if/else → look for tests covering BOTH the true AND false path
- An error handler → look for a test that triggers that specific error condition
- A call to `helperFn()` that has its own branches → those branches need tests too
- A user flow → look for an integration or E2E test that walks through the journey
- An interaction edge case → look for a test that simulates the unexpected action

Quality scoring rubric:
- ★★★  Tests behavior with edge cases AND error paths
- ★★   Tests correct behavior, happy path only
- ★    Smoke test / existence check / trivial assertion (e.g., "it renders", "it doesn't throw")

### E2E Test Decision Matrix

When checking each branch, also determine whether a unit test or E2E/integration test is the right tool:

**RECOMMEND E2E (mark as [→E2E] in the diagram):**
- Common user flow spanning 3+ components/services (e.g., signup → verify email → first login)
- Integration point where mocking hides real failures (e.g., API → queue → worker → DB)
- Auth/payment/data-destruction flows — too important to trust unit tests alone

**RECOMMEND EVAL (mark as [→EVAL] in the diagram):**
- Critical LLM call that needs a quality eval (e.g., prompt change → test output still meets quality bar)
- Changes to prompt templates, system instructions, or tool definitions

**STICK WITH UNIT TESTS:**
- Pure function with clear inputs/outputs
- Internal helper with no side effects
- Edge case of a single function (null input, empty array)
- Obscure/rare flow that isn't customer-facing

### REGRESSION RULE (mandatory)

**IRON RULE:** When the coverage audit identifies a REGRESSION — code that previously worked but the diff broke — a regression test is written immediately. No skipping. Regressions are the highest-priority test because they prove something broke.

A regression is when:
- The diff modifies existing behavior (not new code)
- The existing test suite (if any) doesn't cover the changed path
- The change introduces a new failure mode for existing callers

When uncertain whether a change is a regression, err on the side of writing the test.

Format: commit as `test: regression test for {what broke}`

**4. Output ASCII coverage diagram:**

Include BOTH code paths and user flows in the same diagram. Mark E2E-worthy and eval-worthy paths:

```

COVERAGE: 5/13 paths tested (38%)

QUALITY:  ★★★: 2  ★★: 2  ★: 1
GAPS: 8 paths need tests (2 need E2E, 1 needs eval)
─────────────────────────────────
```

**Fast path:** All paths covered → "Step 3.4: All new code paths have test coverage ✓" Continue.

**5. Generate tests for uncovered paths:**

If test framework detected (or bootstrapped in Step 2.5):
- Prioritize error handlers and edge cases first (happy paths are more likely already tested)
- Read 2-3 existing test files to match conventions exactly
- Generate unit tests. Mock all external dependencies (DB, API, Redis).
- For paths marked [→E2E]: generate integration/E2E tests using the project's E2E framework (Playwright, Cypress, Capybara, etc.)
- For paths marked [→EVAL]: generate eval tests using the project's eval framework, or flag for manual eval if none exists
- Write tests that exercise the specific uncovered path with real assertions
- Run each test. Passes → commit as `test: coverage for {feature}`
- Fails → fix once. Still fails → revert, note gap in diagram.

Caps: 30 code paths max, 20 tests generated max (code + user flow combined), 2-min per-test exploration cap.

If no test framework AND user declined bootstrap → diagram only, no generation. Note: "Test generation skipped — no test framework configured."

**Diff is test-only changes:** Skip Step 3.4 entirely: "No new application code paths to audit."

**6. After-count and coverage summary:**

```bash
# Count test files after generation
find . -name '*.test.*' -o -name '*.spec.*' -o -name '*_test.*' -o -name '*_spec.*' | grep -v node_modules | wc -l
```

For PR body: `Tests: {before} → {after} (+{delta} new)`
Coverage line: `Test Coverage Audit: N new code paths. M covered (X%). K tests generated, J committed.`

**7. Coverage gate:**

Before proceeding, check project configuration files for a test coverage section with `Minimum:` and `Target:` fields. If found, use those percentages. Otherwise use defaults: Minimum = 60%, Target = 80%.

Using the coverage percentage from the diagram in substep 4 (the `COVERAGE: X/Y (Z%)` line):

- **>= target:** Pass. "Coverage gate: PASS ({X}%)." Continue.
- **>= minimum, < target:** Ask the user: "AI-assessed coverage is {X}%. {N} code paths are untested. Target is {target}%. Options: A) Generate more tests for remaining gaps (recommended), B) Ship anyway — I accept the coverage risk, C) These paths don't need tests — mark as intentionally uncovered."
  - If A: Loop back to substep 5 (generate tests) targeting the remaining gaps. After second pass, if still below target, ask again with updated numbers. Maximum 2 generation passes total.
  - If B: Continue. Include in PR body: "Coverage gate: {X}% — user accepted risk."
  - If C: Continue. Include in PR body: "Coverage gate: {X}% — {N} paths intentionally uncovered."

- **< minimum:** Ask the user: "AI-assessed coverage is critically low ({X}%). {N} of {M} code paths have no tests. Minimum threshold is {minimum}%. Options: A) Generate tests for remaining gaps (recommended), B) Override — ship with low coverage."
  - If A: Loop back to substep 5. Maximum 2 passes. If still below minimum after 2 passes, present the override choice again.
  - If B: Continue. Include in PR body: "Coverage gate: OVERRIDDEN at {X}%."

**Coverage percentage undetermined:** If the coverage diagram doesn't produce a clear numeric percentage (ambiguous output, parse error), **skip the gate** with: "Coverage gate: could not determine percentage — skipping." Do not default to 0% or block.

**Test-only diffs:** Skip the gate (same as the existing fast-path).

**100% coverage:** "Coverage gate: PASS (100%)." Continue.

### Test Plan Artifact

After producing the coverage diagram, write a test plan artifact to `$M/reports/ship-test-plan-{branch}.md`:

```markdown
# Test Plan
Generated by /ship on {date}
Branch: {branch}
Repo: {owner/repo}

## Affected Pages/Routes
- {URL path} — {what to test and why}

## Key Interactions to Verify
- {interaction description} on {page}

## Edge Cases
- {edge case} on {page}

## Critical Paths
- {end-to-end flow that must work}
```

---

## Step 3.45: Plan Completion Audit

### Plan File Discovery

1. **Conversation context (primary):** Check if there is an active plan file in this conversation. The host agent's system messages include plan file paths when in plan mode. If found, use it directly — this is the most reliable signal.

2. **Content-based search (fallback):** If no plan file is referenced in conversation context, search by content:

```bash
setopt +o nomatch 2>/dev/null || true  # zsh compat
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null | tr '/' '-')
REPO=$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)")
# Search $M/plans/ for a relevant plan file
PLAN=$(ls -t "$M/plans/"*.md 2>/dev/null | xargs grep -l "$BRANCH" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
[ -z "$PLAN" ] && PLAN=$(ls -t "$M/plans/"*.md 2>/dev/null | xargs grep -l "$REPO" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
[ -z "$PLAN" ] && PLAN=$(ls -t "$M/plans/"*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1)
[ -n "$PLAN" ] && echo "PLAN_FILE: $PLAN" || echo "NO_PLAN_FILE"
```

3. **Validation:** If a plan file was found via content-based search (not conversation context), read the first 20 lines and verify it is relevant to the current branch's work. If it appears to be from a different project or feature, treat as "no plan file found."

**Error handling:**
- No plan file found → skip with "No plan file detected — skipping."
- Plan file found but unreadable (permissions, encoding) → skip with "Plan file found but unreadable — skipping."

### Actionable Item Extraction

Read the plan file. Extract every actionable item — anything that describes work to be done. Look for:

- **Checkbox items:** `- [ ] ...` or `- [x] ...`
- **Numbered steps** under implementation headings: "1. Create ...", "2. Add ...", "3. Modify ..."
- **Imperative statements:** "Add X to Y", "Create a Z service", "Modify the W controller"
- **File-level specifications:** "New file: path/to/file.ts", "Modify path/to/existing.rb"
- **Test requirements:** "Test that X", "Add test for Y", "Verify Z"
- **Data model changes:** "Add column X to table Y", "Create migration for Z"

**Ignore:**
- Context/Background sections (`## Context`, `## Background`, `## Problem`)
- Questions and open items (marked with ?, "TBD", "TODO: decide")
- Review report sections
- Explicitly deferred items ("Future:", "Out of scope:", "NOT in scope:", "P2:", "P3:", "P4:")
- CEO Review Decisions sections (these record choices, not work items)

**Cap:** Extract at most 50 items. If the plan has more, note: "Showing top 50 of N plan items — full list in plan file."

**No items found:** If the plan contains no extractable actionable items, skip with: "Plan file contains no actionable items — skipping completion audit."

For each item, note:
- The item text (verbatim or concise summary)
- Its category: CODE | TEST | MIGRATION | CONFIG | DOCS

### Cross-Reference Against Diff

Run `git diff origin/<base>...HEAD` and `git log origin/<base>..HEAD --oneline` to understand what was implemented.

For each extracted plan item, check the diff and classify:

- **DONE** — Clear evidence in the diff that this item was implemented. Cite the specific file(s) changed.
- **PARTIAL** — Some work toward this item exists in the diff but it's incomplete (e.g., model created but controller missing, function exists but edge cases not handled).
- **NOT DONE** — No evidence in the diff that this item was addressed.
- **CHANGED** — The item was implemented using a different approach than the plan described, but the same goal is achieved. Note the difference.

**Be conservative with DONE** — require clear evidence in the diff. A file being touched is not enough; the specific functionality described must be present.
**Be generous with CHANGED** — if the goal is met by different means, that counts as addressed.

### Output Format

```
PLAN COMPLETION AUDIT
═══════════════════════════════
Plan: {plan file path}

## Implementation Items
  [DONE]      Create UserService — src/services/user_service.rb (+142 lines)
  [PARTIAL]   Add validation — model validates but missing controller checks
  [NOT DONE]  Add caching layer — no cache-related changes in diff
  [CHANGED]   "Redis queue" → implemented with Sidekiq instead

## Test Items
  [DONE]      Unit tests for UserService — test/services/user_service_test.rb
  [NOT DONE]  E2E test for signup flow

## Migration Items
  [DONE]      Create users table — db/migrate/20240315_create_users.rb

─────────────────────────────────
COMPLETION: 4/7 DONE, 1 PARTIAL, 1 NOT DONE, 1 CHANGED
─────────────────────────────────
```

### Gate Logic

After producing the completion checklist:

- **All DONE or CHANGED:** Pass. "Plan completion: PASS — all items addressed." Continue.
- **Only PARTIAL items (no NOT DONE):** Continue with a note in the PR body. Not blocking.
- **Any NOT DONE items:** Ask the user: show the completion checklist. "{N} items from the plan are NOT DONE." Options: A) Stop — implement the missing items before shipping, B) Ship anyway — note as deferred in PR body, C) These items were intentionally dropped — remove from scope.
  - If A: STOP. List the missing items for the user to implement.
  - If B: Continue. Note deferred items in the PR body.
  - If C: Continue. Note in PR body: "Plan items intentionally dropped: {list}."

**No plan file found:** Skip entirely. "No plan file detected — skipping plan completion audit."

**Include in PR body (Step 8):** Add a `## Plan Completion` section with the checklist summary.

---

## Step 3.47: Plan Verification

Automatically verify the plan's testing/verification steps using the `/qa-only` skill.

### 1. Check for verification section

Using the plan file already discovered in Step 3.45, look for a verification section. Match any of these headings: `## Verification`, `## Test plan`, `## Testing`, `## How to test`, `## Manual testing`, or any section with verification-flavored items (URLs to visit, things to check visually, interactions to test).

**If no verification section found:** Skip with "No verification steps found in plan — skipping auto-verification."
**If no plan file was found in Step 3.45:** Skip (already handled).

### 2. Check for running dev server

Before invoking browse-based verification, check if a dev server is reachable:

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' http://localhost:3000 2>/dev/null || \
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' http://localhost:8080 2>/dev/null || \
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' http://localhost:5173 2>/dev/null || \
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' http://localhost:4000 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_SERVER"
```

**If NO_SERVER:** Skip with "No dev server detected — skipping plan verification. Run /qa separately after deploying."

### 3. Invoke /qa-only inline

Refer to the qa-only skill for the verification workflow, with these modifications:
- **Skip any preamble** (already handled by /ship)
- **Use the plan's verification section as the primary test input** — treat each verification item as a test case
- **Use the detected dev server URL** as the base URL
- **Skip the fix loop** — this is report-only verification during /ship
- **Cap at the verification items from the plan** — do not expand into general site QA

### 4. Gate logic

- **All verification items PASS:** Continue silently. "Plan verification: PASS."
- **Any FAIL:** Ask the user: show the failures. Options: A) Fix the failures before shipping (recommended for functional issues), B) Ship anyway — known issues (acceptable for cosmetic issues).
- **No verification section / no server / unreadable skill:** Skip (non-blocking).

### 5. Include in PR body

Add a `## Verification Results` section to the PR body (Step 8):
- If verification ran: summary of results (N PASS, M FAIL, K SKIPPED)
- If skipped: reason for skipping (no plan, no server, no verification section)



## Step 3.48: Scope Drift Detection

Before reviewing code quality, check: **did they build what was requested — nothing more, nothing less?**

1. Read PR description (`gh pr view --json body --jq .body 2>/dev/null || true`).
   Read commit messages (`git log origin/<base>..HEAD --oneline`).
   **If no PR exists:** rely on commit messages and any plan file found in Step 3.45 for stated intent.
2. Identify the **stated intent** — what was this branch supposed to accomplish?
3. Run `git diff origin/<base>...HEAD --stat` and compare the files changed against the stated intent.

4. Evaluate with skepticism (incorporating plan completion results if available from an earlier step or adjacent section):

   **SCOPE CREEP detection:**
   - Files changed that are unrelated to the stated intent
   - New features or refactors not mentioned in the plan
   - "While I was in there..." changes that expand blast radius

   **MISSING REQUIREMENTS detection:**
   - Requirements from the PR description not addressed in the diff
   - Test coverage gaps for stated requirements
   - Partial implementations (started but not finished)

5. Output (before the main review begins):
   \`\`\`
   Scope Check: [CLEAN / DRIFT DETECTED / REQUIREMENTS MISSING]
   Intent: <1-line summary of what was requested>
   Delivered: <1-line summary of what the diff actually does>
   [If drift: list each out-of-scope change]
   [If missing: list each unaddressed requirement]
   \`\`\`

6. This is **INFORMATIONAL** — does not block the review. Proceed to the next step.

---

---

## Step 3.5: Pre-Landing Review

Review the diff for structural issues that tests don't catch.

1. Read the review checklist (e.g., `skillsets/gstack/review/checklist.md` or the project's review checklist). If no checklist is available, proceed with standard review practices.

2. Run `git diff origin/<base>` to get the full diff (scoped to feature changes against the freshly-fetched base branch).

3. Apply the review checklist in two passes:
   - **Pass 1 (CRITICAL):** SQL & Data Safety, LLM Output Trust Boundary
   - **Pass 2 (INFORMATIONAL):** All remaining categories

## Confidence Calibration

Every finding MUST include a confidence score (1-10):

| Score | Meaning | Display rule |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| 9-10 | Verified by reading specific code. Concrete bug or exploit demonstrated. | Show normally |
| 7-8 | High confidence pattern match. Very likely correct. | Show normally |
| 5-6 | Moderate. Could be a false positive. | Show with caveat: "Medium confidence, verify this is actually an issue" |
| 3-4 | Low confidence. Pattern is suspicious but may be fine. | Suppress from main report. Include in appendix only. |
| 1-2 | Speculation. | Only report if severity would be P0. |

**Finding format:**

\`[SEVERITY] (confidence: N/10) file:line — description\`

Example:
\`[P1] (confidence: 9/10) app/models/user.rb:42 — SQL injection via string interpolation in where clause\`
\`[P2] (confidence: 5/10) app/controllers/api/v1/users_controller.rb:18 — Possible N+1 query, verify with production logs\`

**Calibration learning:** If you report a finding with confidence < 7 and the user
confirms it IS a real issue, that is a calibration event. Your initial confidence was
too low. Log the corrected pattern as a learning so future reviews catch it with
higher confidence.

## Design Review (conditional, diff-scoped)

Check if the diff touches frontend files:

```bash
git diff origin/<base> --name-only | grep -qE '\.(tsx?|jsx?|css|scss|html|vue|svelte)' && SCOPE_FRONTEND=true || SCOPE_FRONTEND=false
```

**If `SCOPE_FRONTEND=false`:** Skip design review silently. No output.

**If `SCOPE_FRONTEND=true`:**

1. **Check for DESIGN.md.** If `DESIGN.md` or `design-system.md` exists in the repo root, read it. All design findings are calibrated against it — patterns blessed in DESIGN.md are not flagged. If not found, use universal design principles.

2. **Read each changed frontend file** (full file, not just diff hunks). Frontend files are identified by the patterns listed in the checklist.

3. **Apply the design checklist** against the changed files. For each item:
   - **[HIGH] mechanical CSS fix** (`outline: none`, `!important`, `font-size < 16px`): classify as AUTO-FIX
   - **[HIGH/MEDIUM] design judgment needed**: classify as ASK
   - **[LOW] intent-based detection**: present as "Possible — verify visually or run /design-review"

4. **Include findings** in the review output under a "Design Review" header, following the output format in the checklist. Design findings merge with code review findings into the same Fix-First flow.


## Step 3.8: Adversarial review (always-on)

Every diff gets an adversarial review. LOC is not a proxy for risk — a 5-line auth change can be critical.

### Adversarial subagent (always runs)

Dispatch via the Agent tool. The subagent has fresh context — no checklist bias from the structured review. This genuine independence catches things the primary reviewer is blind to.

Subagent prompt:
"Read the diff for this branch with `git diff origin/<base>`. Think like an attacker and a chaos engineer. Your job is to find ways this code will fail in production. Look for: edge cases, race conditions, security holes, resource leaks, failure modes, silent data corruption, logic errors that produce wrong results silently, error handling that swallows failures, and trust boundary violations. Be adversarial. Be thorough. No compliments — just the problems. For each finding, classify as FIXABLE (you know how to fix it) or INVESTIGATE (needs human judgment)."

Present findings under an `ADVERSARIAL REVIEW (subagent):` header. **FIXABLE findings** flow into the same Fix-First pipeline as the structured review. **INVESTIGATE findings** are presented as informational.

If the subagent fails or times out: "Adversarial subagent unavailable. Continuing."

---

## Step 4: Version bump (auto-decide)

**Idempotency check:** Before bumping, compare VERSION against the base branch.

```bash
BASE_VERSION=$(git show origin/<base>:VERSION 2>/dev/null || echo "0.0.0.0")
CURRENT_VERSION=$(cat VERSION 2>/dev/null || echo "0.0.0.0")
echo "BASE: $BASE_VERSION  HEAD: $CURRENT_VERSION"
if [ "$CURRENT_VERSION" != "$BASE_VERSION" ]; then echo "ALREADY_BUMPED"; fi
```

If output shows `ALREADY_BUMPED`, VERSION was already bumped on this branch (prior `/ship` run). Skip the bump action (do not modify VERSION), but read the current VERSION value — it is needed for CHANGELOG and PR body. Continue to the next step. Otherwise proceed with the bump.

1. Read the current `VERSION` file (4-digit format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.MICRO`)

2. **Auto-decide the bump level based on the diff:**
   - Count lines changed (`git diff origin/<base>...HEAD --stat | tail -1`)
   - Check for feature signals: new route/page files (e.g. `app/*/page.tsx`, `pages/*.ts`), new DB migration/schema files, new test files alongside new source files, or branch name starting with `feat/`
   - **MICRO** (4th digit): < 50 lines changed, trivial tweaks, typos, config
   - **PATCH** (3rd digit): 50+ lines changed, no feature signals detected
   - **MINOR** (2nd digit): **ASK the user** if ANY feature signal is detected, OR 500+ lines changed, OR new modules/packages added
   - **MAJOR** (1st digit): **ASK the user** — only for milestones or breaking changes

3. Compute the new version:
   - Bumping a digit resets all digits to its right to 0
   - Example: `0.19.1.0` + PATCH → `0.19.2.0`

4. Write the new version to the `VERSION` file.

---

## CHANGELOG (auto-generate)

1. Read `CHANGELOG.md` header to know the format.

2. **First, enumerate every commit on the branch:**
   ```bash
   git log <base>..HEAD --oneline
   ```
   Copy the full list. Count the commits. You will use this as a checklist.

3. **Read the full diff** to understand what each commit actually changed:
   ```bash
   git diff <base>...HEAD
   ```

4. **Group commits by theme** before writing anything. Common themes:
   - New features / capabilities
   - Performance improvements
   - Bug fixes
   - Dead code removal / cleanup
   - Infrastructure / tooling / tests
   - Refactoring

5. **Write the CHANGELOG entry** covering ALL groups:
   - If existing CHANGELOG entries on the branch already cover some commits, replace them with one unified entry for the new version
   - Categorize changes into applicable sections:
     - `### Added` — new features
     - `### Changed` — changes to existing functionality
     - `### Fixed` — bug fixes
     - `### Removed` — removed features
   - Write concise, descriptive bullet points
   - Insert after the file header (line 5), dated today
   - Format: `## [X.Y.Z.W] - YYYY-MM-DD`
   - **Voice:** Lead with what the user can now **do** that they couldn't before. Use plain language, not implementation details.

6. **Cross-check:** Compare your CHANGELOG entry against the commit list from step 2.
   Every commit must map to at least one bullet point. If any commit is unrepresented,
   add it now. If the branch has N commits spanning K themes, the CHANGELOG must
   reflect all K themes.

**Do NOT ask the user to describe changes.** Infer from the diff and commit history.

---


## Step 6: Commit (bisectable chunks)

**Goal:** Create small, logical commits that work well with `git bisect` and help LLMs understand what changed.

1. Analyze the diff and group changes into logical commits. Each commit should represent **one coherent change** — not one file, but one logical unit.

2. **Commit ordering** (earlier commits first):
   - **Infrastructure:** migrations, config changes, route additions
   - **Models & services:** new models, services, concerns (with their tests)
   - **Controllers & views:** controllers, views, JS/React components (with their tests)
   - **VERSION + CHANGELOG:** always in the final commit

3. **Rules for splitting:**
   - A model and its test file go in the same commit
   - A service and its test file go in the same commit
   - A controller, its views, and its test go in the same commit
   - Migrations are their own commit (or grouped with the model they support)
   - Config/route changes can group with the feature they enable
   - If the total diff is small (< 50 lines across < 4 files), a single commit is fine

4. **Each commit must be independently valid** — no broken imports, no references to code that doesn't exist yet. Order commits so dependencies come first.

5. Compose each commit message:
   - First line: `<type>: <summary>` (type = feat/fix/chore/refactor/docs)
   - Body: brief description of what this commit contains
   - Only the **final commit** (VERSION + CHANGELOG) gets the version tag and co-author trailer:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
chore: bump version and changelog (vX.Y.Z.W)

EOF
)"
```

---

## Step 6.5: Verification Gate

**IRON LAW: NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE.**

Before pushing, re-verify if code changed during Steps 4-6:

1. **Test verification:** If ANY code changed after Step 3's test run (fixes from review findings, CHANGELOG edits don't count), re-run the test suite. Paste fresh output. Stale output from Step 3 is NOT acceptable.

2. **Build verification:** If the project has a build step, run it. Paste output.

3. **Rationalization prevention:**
   - "Should work now" → RUN IT.
   - "I'm confident" → Confidence is not evidence.
   - "I already tested earlier" → Code changed since then. Test again.
   - "It's a trivial change" → Trivial changes break production.

**If tests fail here:** STOP. Do not push. Fix the issue and return to Step 3.

Claiming work is complete without verification is dishonesty, not efficiency.

---

## Step 7: Push

**Idempotency check:** Check if the branch is already pushed and up to date.

```bash
git fetch origin <branch-name> 2>/dev/null
LOCAL=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
REMOTE=$(git rev-parse origin/<branch-name> 2>/dev/null || echo "none")
echo "LOCAL: $LOCAL  REMOTE: $REMOTE"
[ "$LOCAL" = "$REMOTE" ] && echo "ALREADY_PUSHED" || echo "PUSH_NEEDED"
```

If `ALREADY_PUSHED`, skip the push but continue to Step 8. Otherwise push with upstream tracking:

```bash
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

---

## Step 8: Create PR/MR

**Idempotency check:** Check if a PR/MR already exists for this branch.

**If GitHub:**
```bash
gh pr view --json url,number,state -q 'if .state == "OPEN" then "PR #\(.number): \(.url)" else "NO_PR" end' 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_PR"
```

**If GitLab:**
```bash
glab mr view -F json 2>/dev/null | jq -r 'if .state == "opened" then "MR_EXISTS" else "NO_MR" end' 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_MR"
```

If an **open** PR/MR already exists: **update** the PR body using `gh pr edit --body "..."` (GitHub) or `glab mr update -d "..."` (GitLab). Always regenerate the PR body from scratch using this run's fresh results (test output, coverage audit, review findings, adversarial review). Never reuse stale PR body content from a prior run. Print the existing URL and continue to Step 8.5.

If no PR/MR exists: create a pull request (GitHub) or merge request (GitLab) using the platform detected in Step 0.

The PR/MR body should contain these sections:

```
## Summary
<Summarize ALL changes being shipped. Run `git log <base>..HEAD --oneline` to enumerate
every commit. Exclude the VERSION/CHANGELOG metadata commit (that's this PR's bookkeeping,
not a substantive change). Group the remaining commits into logical sections (e.g.,
"**Performance**", "**Dead Code Removal**", "**Infrastructure**"). Every substantive commit
must appear in at least one section. If a commit's work isn't reflected in the summary,
you missed it.>

## Test Coverage
<coverage diagram from Step 3.4, or "All new code paths have test coverage.">
<If Step 3.4 ran: "Tests: {before} → {after} (+{delta} new)">

## Pre-Landing Review
<findings from Step 3.5 code review, or "No issues found.">

## Design Review
<If design review ran: "Design Review (lite): N findings — M auto-fixed, K skipped. AI Slop: clean/N issues.">
<If no frontend files changed: "No frontend files changed — design review skipped.">

## Eval Results
<If evals ran: suite names, pass/fail counts, cost dashboard summary. If skipped: "No prompt-related files changed — evals skipped.">



## Scope Drift
<If scope drift ran: "Scope Check: CLEAN" or list of drift/creep findings>
<If no scope drift: omit this section>

## Plan Completion
<If plan file found: completion checklist summary from Step 3.45>
<If no plan file: "No plan file detected.">
<If plan items deferred: list deferred items>

## Verification Results
<If verification ran: summary from Step 3.47 (N PASS, M FAIL, K SKIPPED)>
<If skipped: reason (no plan, no server, no verification section)>
<If not applicable: omit this section>

## Test plan
- [x] All tests pass
```

**If GitHub:**

```bash
gh pr create --base <base> --title "<type>: <summary>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
<PR body from above>
EOF
)"
```

**If GitLab:**

```bash
glab mr create -b <base> -t "<type>: <summary>" -d "$(cat <<'EOF'
<MR body from above>
EOF
)"
```

**If neither CLI is available:**
Print the branch name, remote URL, and instruct the user to create the PR/MR manually via the web UI. Do not stop — the code is pushed and ready.

**Output the PR/MR URL** — then proceed to Step 8.5.

---

## Step 8.5: Auto-invoke /document-release

After the PR is created, automatically sync project documentation. Read the
`document-release/SKILL.md` skill file (adjacent to this skill's directory) and
execute its full workflow:

1. Read the `/document-release` skill from the adjacent `document-release/SKILL.md` file.
2. Follow its instructions — it reads all .md files in the project, cross-references
   the diff, and updates anything that drifted (README, ARCHITECTURE, CONTRIBUTING, etc.)
3. If any docs were updated, commit the changes and push to the same branch:
   ```bash
   git add -A && git commit -m "docs: sync documentation with shipped changes" && git push
   ```
4. If no docs needed updating, say "Documentation is current — no updates needed."

This step is automatic. Do not ask the user for confirmation. The goal is zero-friction
doc updates — the user runs `/ship` and documentation stays current without a separate command.

If Step 8.5 created a docs commit, re-edit the PR/MR body to include the latest commit SHA in the summary. This ensures the PR body reflects the truly final state after document-release.

## Important Rules

- **Never skip tests.** If tests fail, stop.
- **Never skip the pre-landing review.** If checklist.md is unreadable, stop.
- **Never force push.** Use regular `git push` only.
- **Never ask for trivial confirmations** (e.g., "ready to push?", "create PR?"). DO stop for: version bumps (MINOR/MAJOR) and pre-landing review findings (ASK items).
- **Always use the 4-digit version format** from the VERSION file.
- **Date format in CHANGELOG:** `YYYY-MM-DD`
- **Split commits for bisectability** — each commit = one logical change.
- **Never push without fresh verification evidence.** If code changed after Step 3 tests, re-run before pushing.
- **Step 3.4 generates coverage tests.** They must pass before committing. Never commit failing tests.
- **The goal is: user says `/ship`, next thing they see is the review + PR URL + auto-synced docs.**
